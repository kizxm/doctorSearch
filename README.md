## Notes **

When building the files for this project from the ground up on Windows, -> make sure to install babelify before running jsBrowserify.

As well, sometimes things don't run right on windows in gitbash - have node.js command prompt handy, and make sure both are run in adminstrator mode.
--> bower init doesn't work in gitbash properly, load in node.js.
--> karma init doesn't work in gitbash properly, load in node.js.
